# Development Workflow Process

## Mandatory Process Flow for All Development Tasks

This document defines the **mandatory workflow** that Claude must follow for all development tasks to prevent errors and ensure proper testing.

### üö® Critical Rules

1. **NEVER mark tasks complete without testing**
2. **ALWAYS work on remote server for builds/tests**
3. **ALWAYS use GitHub MCP server for GitHub operations**
4. **ALWAYS report back with results**
5. **ALWAYS follow the TODO workflow**

### üìã Step-by-Step Process

#### Phase 1: Task Planning
```
1. Create comprehensive TODO list
2. Break down complex tasks into testable steps
3. Identify which tasks need local vs remote work
4. Mark first task as "in_progress"
```

#### Phase 2: Server Context Decision
```
LOCAL ONLY:
- Documentation writing
- Git operations (commit, push)
- Code editing
- File creation

REMOTE ONLY:
- Docker builds
- Container testing
- Service deployment
- System configuration
- Port/network testing

BOTH (Local ‚Üí Remote):
- Create files locally
- Commit and push
- Pull and test on remote
```

#### Phase 3: Execution

**For Local Work:**
```
1. Work in local environment
2. Create/edit files as needed
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
4. Push to repository
5. Update TODO status
```

**For Remote Work:**
```
1. Connect via SSH MCP server
2. Verify connection: whoami && hostname && pwd
3. Navigate to project directory
4. Pull latest changes from repository
5. Execute the task
6. Test and verify results
7. ONLY mark complete if tests pass
```

**For GitHub Operations:**
```
1. Use GitHub MCP server tools (PRIMARY)
2. Use gh CLI only for Projects V2 or as backup
3. Examples:
   - mcp_github-mcp-server_create_issue (NOT gh issue create)
   - mcp_github-mcp-server_list_issues (NOT gh issue list)
```

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

**Before Marking Complete:**
```
1. Run actual tests (build, deploy, access)
2. Verify functionality works as expected
3. Check logs for errors
4. Test integration points
5. Document any issues found
```

**Testing Examples:**
```
Docker Build: docker build -t image:tag .
Service Test: curl http://localhost:port/health
Container Run: docker run -d --name test image:tag
Log Check: docker logs container_name
```

#### Phase 5: Completion & Reporting

**Task Completion:**
```
1. Mark TODO as completed ONLY after successful testing
2. Update issue with progress
3. Report results to user with specific details
4. Move to next task or mark issue complete
```

**Reporting Format:**
```
REPORT:
‚úÖ/‚ùå [Task Status]
- Server: [hostname]
- Action: [what was done]
- Result: [what was found/created/status]
- Tests: [what tests were run]
- Issues: [any problems encountered]
```

### üîÑ Error Recovery Process

**When Things Go Wrong:**
```
1. Stop current process
2. Identify what went wrong
3. Update TODO status to reflect reality
4. Clean up any partial work
5. Fix the issue
6. Re-test from the beginning
7. Only then mark as complete
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
```
‚ùå Working locally for Docker builds
‚ùå Marking tasks complete without testing
‚ùå Using gh CLI instead of GitHub MCP server
‚ùå Not reporting back to user
‚ùå Skipping the TODO workflow
‚ùå Not cleaning up failed attempts
```

### üìä Process Validation Checklist

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] Task was executed in correct environment (local/remote)
- [ ] All tests passed successfully
- [ ] Integration points work correctly
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Changes are committed and pushed
- [ ] User has been informed of results

### üéØ Success Criteria

A task is only complete when:

1. **Functionality works** as specified
2. **Tests pass** in the target environment
3. **Integration** with existing systems verified
4. **Documentation** is updated
5. **Code is committed** and pushed
6. **User is informed** with detailed report

### üîß Tools & Commands Reference

**SSH MCP Server:**
```
mcp_ssh-mcp-server_exec: whoami && hostname && pwd
mcp_ssh-mcp-server_exec: cd project && git pull origin branch
mcp_ssh-mcp-server_exec: docker build -t image .
```

**GitHub MCP Server:**
```
mcp_github-mcp-server_list_issues(owner="user", repo="repo")
mcp_github-mcp-server_create_issue(owner="user", repo="repo", title="Title")
mcp_github-mcp-server_get_issue(owner="user", repo="repo", issue_number=13)
```

**TODO Management:**
```
todo_write(merge=true, todos=[{id, content, status}])
Status options: "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "cancelled"
```

### üìà Continuous Improvement

This process should be:
- **Followed strictly** for all development tasks
- **Updated** when new patterns emerge
- **Referenced** when things go wrong
- **Used as training** for consistent behavior

---

**Remember: The goal is reliable, tested, working code - not just files that look correct!**
