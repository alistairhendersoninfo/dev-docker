# V2 Migration Strategy

## Current Analysis:
- DraftIssues are ALREADY V2 native tasks âœ“
- Issue #13 and PR #14 are OLD workflow artifacts (need removal)
- Scripts/docs need updating to work with DraftIssue format only

## Actions Required:
1. Remove linked Issue #13 and PR #14 from project
2. Keep all 16 DraftIssues as V2 native tasks
3. Update scripts to work with DraftIssue format
4. Update documentation for V2-only workflow
