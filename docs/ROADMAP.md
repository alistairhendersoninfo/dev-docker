# Development Docker Environment - Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform Docker development workflow by providing a clean, automated system for building and launching development containers with zero configuration overhead.

## 🚀 Current Status: Core Architecture Complete ✅

### **What's Working Now:**

- ✅ **Build System**: Separate image building with Build-Docker-Images.sh
- ✅ **Launch System**: Container orchestration with Launch-Docker-Services.sh
- ✅ **Base Images**: Minimal, Development, Playwright, Traefik, DNS images
- ✅ **Persistent Configuration**: Local config system that survives git pulls
- ✅ **Image Registry**: Tracking of built images (standard + custom)
- ✅ **Singleton Services**: DNS/Traefik conflict detection and handling
- ✅ **Service Integration**: Traefik reverse proxy with SSL automation
- ✅ **Development Tools**: SSH access, project creation scripts
